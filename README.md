The goal of this work is to extract valuable insights hidden within user reviews of the well-known Chinese e-commerce app Temu.\
This study uses LDA to analyze pre-processed text reviews and extract relevant topics along with related terms. \
Subsequently, keywords are identified based on their frequency and categorized into specific e-commerce features. \
The reviews are then segmented into two clusters according to their rating ('positive' and 'negative') and association rule mining is employed to uncover the relationship between these features and the assigned rating.

Two main questions are addressed:
1. What are the main topics discussed in the user reviews?
2. Which features do users view positively and which negatively?
 
By uncovering key topics and identifying what users like and dislike, this research aims to assist companies in refining their e-commerce strategies, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and
loyalty in the competitive digital marketplace.
